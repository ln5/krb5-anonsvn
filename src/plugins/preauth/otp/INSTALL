# Kerberos FAST OTP plugin INSTALL file (in Emacs -*-org-*- mode)

#+TITLE: Kerberos FAST OTP plugin installation and configuration
#+EMAIL: linus@nordu.net

This is the INSTALL file in the plugins/preauth/otp directory of the
MIT Kerberos tree, describing how to get going with the One-Time
Passoword (OTP) plugin.

In order to try out the plugin you'll want to install kinit, the KDC
and some OTP verification backend (or use someone elses).  The
information in this document should be enough to get you going.

* Get the source code

- git clone https://github.com/ln5/krb5-anonsvn.git
- cd krb5-anonsvn

An alternative way of getting the source code if you don't do git is
to visit

- https://nodeload.github.com/ln5/krb5-anonsvn/tarball/fast-otp

and pick a recent snapshot of the source tree.

* Compile and install it
NOTE: In order to use the 'basicauth' OTP method you'll want [[http://curl.haxx.se/][libcurl]]
installed on your system prior to configuring Kerberos.

NOTE: In order to use the 'ykclient' OTP method you'll want the
[[https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-c-client/][Yubikey client C library]] installed on your system prior to configuring
Kerberos.

- autoreconf -i
- ./configure --enable-otp-preauth
- make all install

If you want debug output from the OTP plugin in kinit and the KDC,
compile the plugin with =-DDEBUG=.
- make -C plugins/preauth/otp CFLAGS="-Wall -g -DDEBUG" clean all install
* Configure the KDC
- Configure the OTP method(s) you intend to use for you realm.  Here's
  an example of how to configure =basicauth=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[realms]
	EXAMPLE.COM = {
		otp_basicauth_url_template = https://otp-verification.example.com/
	}
#+END_EXAMPLE

- You'll want to enable the OTP plugin in =etc/krb5.conf=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[plugins]
	enable_only = otp
	kdcpreauth = {
		   module = otp:preauth/otp.so
        }
	clpreauth = {
		  module = otp:preauth/otp.so
        }
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Add a principal to the Kerberos database
- Create a normal principal using kadmin.
- Set the =requires_preauth= attribute.
- Add a string attribute =otp-token1= providing the OTP token identity
  and the name of the OTP method to be used for OTP verification.

Here's an example of how to create =mit0@EXAMPLE.COM= and configure
=basicauth= as the OTP method to use for authentication.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ kadmin.local 
kadmin.local:  ank -randkey +requires_preauth mit0
Principal "mit0@EXAMPLE.COM" created.
kadmin.local:  set_string mit0 otp-token1 mit0:basicauth
Attribute set for principal "mit0@EXAMPLE.COM".
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Start the KDC
- krb5kdc -n

If you want debug printouts from the KDC on standard output, set
=KRB5_TRACE= to =/dev/stdout= before starting the KDC.
- KRB5\_TRACE=/dev/stdout krb5kdc -n
* Get yourself an OTP token
** You have a Yubikey OTP token
The [[http://www.yubico.com/yubikey][Yubikey token]] can be used in one of three modes -- Yubico mode,
OATH-HOTP mode and Challenge-response mode.

The OTP plugin can authenticate a Yubikey in Yubico mode through the
'ykclient' method.

The OTP plugin can authenticate a Yubikey in OATH-HOTP mode through
the 'basicauth' method, given that the KDC can connect to a
verification backend making itself available over HTTP or HTTPS using
HTTP Basic Authentication for authentication.
*** Install ykpersonalize
- https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization

This will in addition to ykpersonalize(1) give you modhex(1), neat for
converting from ASCII hex representation to the Yubikey ASCII "modhex"
representation, chosen for being in the same place on most keyboard
layouts (equivalent to
=tr "[0123456789abcdef]" "[cbdefghijklnrtuv]"=).
*** Configure your Yubikey using ykpersonalize
**** OATH-HOTP mode
Pick a Yubikey public identity (1), a uid (aabbccddee00) and a 20 character AES key (12345678901234567890)
: ykpersonalize -y -ooath-hotp -a$(echo -n 12345678901234567890 | hexdump -e \"%02x\")
**** Yubico mode
Pick a Yubikey public identity (1), a uid (aabbccddee00) and a 16 character AES key (1234567890123456)
: ykpersonalize -y -ofixed=h:280000000001 -ouid=aabbccddee00 -a$(echo -n 1234567890123456 | hexdump -e \"%02x\")
** You don't have any of the above mentioned hardware tokens
You can use a program for generating one-time passwords.
*** The Oath-toolkit package
[[http://freshmeat.net/projects/oath-toolkit][OATH Toolkit]] can be used for generating OATH OTP's, both HOTP and TOTP.
- oathtool -d <OTP-length> -c <counter> <key>
*** iPhone application "OATH Token"
Visit https://kfo-dev.nordu.net/ for the following links.
- [[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oath-token/id364017137%3Fmt%3D8][OATH Token in Apple's appstore]]
- [[http://kfo-dev.nordu.net/cgi-bin/gentoken.cgi][Generate a token]] in the NORDUnet test site, page protected with
  Basic Authentication
- [[https://kfo-dev.nordu.net/protected][Test your token]] in the NORDUnet test site
* Generate an OTP
- Using oathtool
: $ oathtool -c a1b50a9c395774cf7071fb07d40243d208adf390
: 531329
- Using a Yubikey in OATH mode or Yubico mode
  - Insert the token in a USB slot
  - Point your cursor at a good place to paste a password
  - Press the key
- Using the iPhone OATH Token application 
  - Start the application
  - Select a token from the list
  - Press "Generate New Password"
* Get a FAST armor key
There are three options.
- Sticking a srvtab in /etc/
- Use PKINIT, supposedly anonymous PKINIT
- Get a TGT for an "ordinary" user with a long-term shared secret
* Use the OTP for authenticate with the KDC
- kinit -T <ccache> -X OTP=<otp> <principal>
Example:
: $ kinit -T /tmp/krb5cc_1000 -X OTP=123456 mit0
* Setting up OTP verification backend systems
If noone is providing you with a OTP backend system, you'll have to
set one up yourself.
** Apache module mod\_authn\_otp, for OATH HOTP tokens
- http://mod-authn-otp.googlecode.com/
- On a Debian-based system, the user database is being kept in
  =/var/lib/apache2/otpusers.db=, see
  https://code.google.com/p/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile for details
  on the format.
- Add basic auth protecting the [[https://kfo-dev.nordu.net/cgi-bin/gentoken.cgi][token generation page]]
: $ sudo htpasswd -b /etc/htpasswd mit0 mit0
- Visit the [[https://kfo-dev.nordu.net/cgi-bin/gentoken.cgi][token generation page]] to get your token

  - If you're on an iPhone with the OATH Token app installed, use the
    Safari browser and your token will be installed to the app.

  - If you're using the Oathtool-toolkit, use any browser or curl to get the key

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ curl --basic --user mit1:mit1 http://kfo-dev.nordu.net/cgi-bin/gentoken.cgi
<html><body><a href="oathtoken:///addToken?name=mit1&key=a1b50a9c395774cf7071fb07d40243d208adf390">here is your token</a></body></html>
